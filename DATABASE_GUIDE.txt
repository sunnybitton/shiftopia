RELATIONSHIPS
------------
- Each WORKSHEET has multiple WORKSHEET_ENTRIES
- STATIONS are referenced in both WORKSHEETS and WORKSHEET_ENTRIES
- USERS can be assigned to shifts in WORKSHEET_ENTRIES
- USERS can have multiple CERTIFICATIONS
- STATIONS can require specific CERTIFICATIONS
- System validates that users have required certifications before assignment

KEY FEATURES
-----------
1. Real-time Updates
   - Changes to worksheets are saved immediately
   - Multiple users can view updates in real-time

2. Data Validation
   - Prevents duplicate assignments
   - Ensures valid dates and stations
   - Validates user permissions

3. History Tracking
   - Keeps track of when entries are created and modified
   - Maintains audit trail of changes

SECURITY
--------
- Passwords are encrypted
- Role-based access control
- Only managers can create/edit worksheets
- Regular employees can only view published worksheets

BEST PRACTICES
-------------
1. Always use the provided API endpoints
2. Don't modify database directly
3. Keep worksheet names consistent (month_year format)
4. Regularly check for inactive stations
5. Use proper error handling when making database changes

API ENDPOINTS
------------

   - GET /users
   - POST /users
   - PUT /users/:id

2. Stations:
   - GET /stations
   - POST /stations
   - PUT /stations/:id
   - DELETE /stations/:id

3. Worksheets:

   - PUT /worksheets/:id/entries/:entryId
   - DELETE /worksheets/:id/entries/:entryId

Remember: The database is designed to be simple but powerful, focusing on maintaining data integrity while providing flexibility for schedule management.
