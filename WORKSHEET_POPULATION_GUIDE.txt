MANUAL WORKSHEET POPULATION GUIDE
==============================

OVERVIEW
--------
When populating a worksheet manually, we need to consider several factors to ensure efficient and error-free scheduling:
1. Station requirements
2. Employee certifications
3. Overlap rules
4. Maximum employee limits

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
-------------------

1. PREPARATION
   - Ensure all stations are properly configured with:
     * Required certifications
     * Maximum employees allowed
     * Overlap settings
     * Color coding for visual organization
   
   - Have ready access to:
     * List of available employees
     * Employee certifications
     * Employee availability

2. POPULATION STRATEGY
   A. Priority-Based Approach
      1. Fill critical stations first
      2. Assign certified employees to specialized positions
      3. Fill remaining stations based on availability
   
   B. Time-Based Approach
      1. Complete one day at a time
      2. Ensure proper coverage across all shifts
      3. Check for overlap compliance

3. VALIDATION CHECKS
   For each assignment, verify:
   - Employee has required certifications
   - Station's maximum employee limit isn't exceeded
   - Overlap rules are followed
   - Employee isn't double-booked
   - Required rest periods are maintained

4. BEST PRACTICES
   - Use color coding to identify different stations quickly
   - Fill in patterns first (regular assignments)
   - Handle exceptions and special cases last
   - Save progress frequently
   - Review assignments for each day before moving to next
   - Use the worksheet's built-in validation features

5. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
   - Don't exceed station's max employee limit
   - Don't assign uncertified employees to specialized stations
   - Don't create scheduling conflicts
   - Don't forget to check overlap rules
   - Don't ignore required rest periods

6. WORKFLOW RECOMMENDATIONS
   A. Order of Operations
      1. Set up station configurations first
      2. Fill in regular/recurring assignments
      3. Add special assignments
      4. Fill gaps with available employees
      5. Review and adjust

   B. Visual Organization
      - Use station colors consistently
      - Group similar stations together
      - Mark completed days/sections
      - Flag potential conflicts

7. VALIDATION PROCESS
   Before Publishing:
   - Check all required positions are filled
   - Verify certification requirements
   - Review employee workload distribution
   - Check for scheduling conflicts
   - Ensure overlap rules are followed
   - Verify maximum employee limits

8. EMERGENCY HANDLING
   Have a plan for:
   - Last-minute changes
   - Sick leave coverage
   - Certification expiration
   - Special events or peak times

API USAGE
---------
1. Check Employee Availability:
   GET /users/:id/availability?month={month}&year={year}

2. Verify Certifications:
   GET /users/:id/certifications

3. Update Worksheet Entry:
   PUT /worksheets/:id/entries/:entryId
   {
     "day": number,
     "workstation": string,
     "employee_assigned": string
   }

4. Batch Update Multiple Entries:
   POST /worksheets/:id/entries/batch
   {
     "entries": [
       {
         "day": number,
         "workstation": string,
         "employee_assigned": string
       }
     ]
   }

SHORTCUTS AND TIPS
-----------------
1. Quick Entry:
   - Use Tab key to move between cells
   - Use Enter to confirm entries
   - Use arrow keys for navigation

2. Bulk Operations:
   - Copy/paste similar patterns
   - Use batch update for recurring assignments
   - Apply filters to view specific stations/days

3. Visual Aids:
   - Use station colors for quick identification
   - Enable validation highlighting
   - Use conflict warnings

Remember: Take your time with initial setup - good preparation makes the population process much smoother and reduces errors.
